# What is a Psychomotive Vigilance Test?
A Reaction Time Test where the subject responds to quick visual stimuli. Since Sleep Debt/Deficit is often tied to slower problem solving, lessened alertedness, and declined psychomotor skills, the test is often used to track the speed and accuracy at which one would react to a quick visual cue. Motivation can counteract the effects listed here, too, so that's also why it returns the average reaction time and asks if you want to retry. So you can be pulled to continue to get faster and faster times.

# How to Install:
Download the latest release. The python exe release file should open up its window on its own.

# How it Works:
A red dot will, in short intervals, appear in the middle of the screen. 
As SOON as you see it, either click inside the tab, or press the space bar. 
This will continue for 60 seconds. Once it's finished, it will give you the average speed at which you clicked the dot.
